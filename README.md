# Variables 
Variable names cannot start with a number and they can only contain alpha numeric characters or underscores. You can't use reserved keywords for variable names. In Python, snake_case is prefered. 
# Indexing
Python is 0 indexed, and you can access indiivdual string characters with an index of where it is. ```string = "Hello World"``` - to print 'r' = ```print(string[9])```, or ```print(string[-3])``` (the negative indexing indicates the end of the string). More than one argument can be used in cases like ```print()```, as long as they're separated by a comma.    
Use 4 spaces for indenting.  
# Syntaxes
```len()``` will show the number of items in the string. So ```print(len(string))``` will print '11'.    
```type()``` will output the data type of the input.   
```.find()``` method will find a value in a variable. So if you want to find 'W' in a string = ```find('W')```.  
```.lower()``` converts to lowercase.  
# Loops
```for``` loops are written as ```for i in blank```. each line under the colon, in the body of the loop, has to be indented.
